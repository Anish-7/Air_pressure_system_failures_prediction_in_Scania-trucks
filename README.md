# Air_pressure_system_failures_prediction_in_Scania-trucks

The dataset consists of data collected from heavy Scania 
trucks in everyday usage. The system in focus is the 
Air Pressure system (APS) which generates pressurised 
air that are utilized in various functions in a truck,
such as braking and gear changes. The datasets' 
positive class consists of component failures 
for a specific component of the APS system. 
The negative class consists of trucks with failures 
for components not related to the APS. The data consists 
of a subset of all available data, selected by experts. 

# Challenge metric  

     Cost-metric of miss-classification:

     Predicted class |      True class       |
                     |    pos    |    neg    |
     -----------------------------------------
      pos            |     -     |  Cost_1   |
     -----------------------------------------
      neg            |  Cost_2   |     -     |
     -----------------------------------------
     Cost_1 = 10 and cost_2 = 500

     The total cost of a prediction model the sum of "Cost_1" 
     multiplied by the number of Instances with type 1 failure 
     and "Cost_2" with the number of instances with type 2 failure, 
     resulting in a "Total_cost".

     In this case Cost_1 refers to the cost that an unnessecary 
     check needs to be done by an mechanic at an workshop, while 
     Cost_2 refer to the cost of missing a faulty truck, 
     which may cause a breakdown.

     Total_cost = Cost_1*No_Instances + Cost_2*No_Instances.
